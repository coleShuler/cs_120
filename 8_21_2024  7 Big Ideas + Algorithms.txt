7 Big Ideas + Algorithms



7 BIG IDEAS

	Variables / Data
	Input / Output
	Operations
	Branching
	Looping
	Functions
	Aggregation

Variables
	Has a Name (Normally one word
	Some languages are loose or strict
	Most common are integer, float, string, and object
Operations
	Things you can do with Variables
	Vary by data type (Numeric, Text, Conversion
Input / Output
	Output (Print something / Normal output text)
	Input (Get information / Implies a variable to hold data)
Branching
	How computer appears to make decisions
	Based on a decision (True / False Expressions)
Loops
	How a computer manages repetition
	All loops have some sort of sentry (Control) variable
Functions
	Allow you to group code
	Each functions is a solution to a sub problem
Aggregate Data
	Many pieces of data combined into a single variable
	Come in many forms (Arrays, Lists, Classes, Dictionaries)



Algorithms

What makes a good algorithm?
	Describe a problem
	Break it down into smaller steps
	Each step is do precise it can be converted into a line or two of code
Pseudocode
	We will use Pseudocode as our form of algorithm
	Each idea as a statement in English
	Should be able to do everything with no issue on paper with no computer
Comments
	Comments are used to explain the code within the computer
	The code is there to explain the comment, to then explain that to the user
