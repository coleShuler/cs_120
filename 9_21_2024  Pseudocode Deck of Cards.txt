Import Random thing

make the variable ((NUMCARDS)) equal 52 to show how many cards we have

write out all card names in a tuple: Ace, Two, Three, Four, Five, Six, Seven, Eight, Nine, Ten, Jack, Queen, King

write out all suit names in a tuple: clubs, hearts, spades, diamonds

write out all hand options in a tuple: deck, player, computer

make the variable ((DECK)) equal 0
make the variable ((PLAYER)) equal 1
make the variable ((COMPUTER)) equal 2

create a function called main()

	make a variable called ((cardDB)) for card data base, that will get 	((initCarts))
	
	make a for loop for i in the range of 5
		this will assign cards from the card data base to the player
		this will assign cards from the card data base to the computer
	
	The function will then display the DB using cardDB

	it will then show the players hand
	it will also then show the computers hand

Make a function for initCards

	run cardDB
	make a for loop to print out the cardDB

Make a function for showDB with (cardDB) inside

	make a for loop that will give the cards there face value
		print out the numbers and assign them to the card name and who has the card

make a function called getCardName with (cardNum) inside

	define rank and suit
	make a variable called ((name)) and make it print out the rank names and suits
	return the new variable ((name))

make a function called assignCard with (cardDB and picked) inside

	make a variable called ((cardNum)) and using the random import, run randrange and use the variable  ((NUMCARDS))
	run cardDB with (cardNum) inside and give those cards to ((picked))

make a function called showHand with (cardDB and picked) inside
	
	give a little extra room to the list with pirint()
	print out the cards in each persons hand text above each caard set
	make a for loop for cardNum and let it find those in cardDB
		make an if statement for each ((location)) thats equal to ((picked))
			print out those cards
run main()
