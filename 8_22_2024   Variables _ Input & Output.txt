Variables
	Every computer program is about data
	Bring in data, manipulate it, and use the data that is brought in
Create a variable you need...
	Its Name
	Its Type
	Its initial Value
(CODE)
	type(5)
		this is a integer
	type(5.1)
		this is a float
	type("name")
		this is a string
	x = 5
		x is an integer
	x = 5.0
		x is a float
Boolean
	extremely limited
	Boolean variables can only contain one of two variables
		True
		False
	Used a lot with looping and branching

(CODE)
	print(f"{name} is {age} years old")
		Cole is 18 years old
	print(name + "is" + age + "years old")
